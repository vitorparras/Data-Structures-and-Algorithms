## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It is intended for educational purposes and to serve as a reference for anyone learning or revising these fundamental concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```

  Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/
  ├── Arrays/
  │   ├── array_example.py
  │   └── README.md
  ├── LinkedLists/
  │   ├── linked_list_example.py
  │   └── README.md
  ├── Trees/
  │   ├── binary_tree_example.py
  │   └── README.md
  ├── Sorting/
  │   ├── quicksort.py
  │   ├── mergesort.py
  │   └── README.md
  ├── Graphs/
  │   ├── graph_example.py
  │   └── README.md
  └── README.md

```

Each folder contains implementations and explanations related to a specific data structure or algorithm.

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Basic operations on arrays, including traversal, insertion, and deletion.
- **LinkedLists**: Implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and more.
- **Graphs**: Representations and traversals (DFS, BFS) of graphs.

## Algorithms

- **Sorting**: Implementations of sorting algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, bubblesort, etc.
- **Search**: Binary search, linear search, and other search algorithms.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the folder of the desired data structure or algorithm.
2. Open the `README.md` file for an explanation of the concept.
3. Review the implementation file (e.g., `array_example.py`) for the code.
4. Run the code using your preferred Python interpreter or IDE.
